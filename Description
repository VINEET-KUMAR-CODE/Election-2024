#📝 Detailed Project Summary – Indian General Election 2024 Power BI Dashboard
🌍 Introduction

The Indian General Election 2024 was one of the largest democratic events in the world 🌎, with:

👥 Millions of voters casting their votes

🏛️ Thousands of constituencies deciding their representatives

🗳️ Multiple political parties competing for leadership

Such a huge event generates an enormous and complex dataset filled with hidden stories, trends, and insights. But raw data in itself is not meaningful — it needs to be analyzed, structured, and visualized to uncover the true picture.

This project uses Power BI to convert election data into an interactive, insightful, and professional dashboard 📊. It enables users to explore state-wise outcomes, party performance, and voting patterns in a clean and structured way, making data both informative and engaging.
